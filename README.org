* TODO Background material

** Disclaimer

These materials makes use of proprietary products and a simplified workflow in
order to emphasise the main concepts and to save on installation and
configuration time. Some references will be given at the end to direct you to
free and open source solutions and more sustainable workflows; the core ideas
are the same though.

** TODO Version control (VC)

*** TODO Reproducible research and Open research

** TODO git

*** TODO Repository

*** TODO Clone

*** TODO Pull

*** TODO Commit

*** TODO Push

*** TODO Fork

*** TODO What is GitHub?

*** Setting up a GitHub account

To register an account you will need an email address that can be used for
verification.

1. Visit [[https://github.com/]] and click *Sign Up*.
2. Fill in the forms to create an account.
3. Verify that account by entering the access code GitHub sends to the email
   address you registered with.
4. Verify that you can summon the *Command Palette* with =crtl k= for Windows and
   Linux and =command k= on a mac.
5. The appearance and accessibility settings can be reached by searching for
   them in the command palette.

** TODO Zenodo

* TODO Worked example

- You start with some code that generates the pictures needed for a manuscript.
  + Start with some dummy data and a single figure that can be put into a dummy document
  + There is a data file and a final figure and a script that makes for later from the former using R.
  + You want to put that onto github so that others can use it, you want others to be able to build off of it
- You start by setting up the materials in a way that are good for this purpose.
  + You need to put a license on this
  + You need to put a readme so people know what it is all about
  + You need to have a sensible layout of the materials
  + You need to record the environment you used to carry out the computation in case someone wants to recreate it exactly
- You make a github account and repository
  + You need to set up an account
  + You need to set up all the access for your machine
  + You make a repository
- You upload it all to github
  + You need to make a copy of this on your machine
  + You need to move all of your materials into that reposotiry
  + You need to push the changes to github
- You get told you need to change something so you do that
  + You need to make a change and push that change
- You might want to archive this on zenodo or something similar

* TODO Next steps and alternative solutions

- You need to know where you can learn more about git
- You need to know what tools are used for what purposes
- You need to know how to navigate github including the issue tracker and assess liveliness

* TODO Homework

** Question 1

- Explain (in 100--200 words) the purpose of git, github, and zenodo and the
  relationship between these things.
- Find and report an alternative to each of these tools (<150 words).

** Question 2

- Explain (in 100--200 words) the role of version control in reproducible
  research.
- Give an example (in <150 words) of a situation in which version control
  does not suffice to make a piece of work reproducible.

** Question 3

- Download the following script and data and organise this material in a
  repository in a suitable way.
- Give a brief overview of the decisions you made along the way (<200 words).

** TODO Question 4

** TODO Question 5
